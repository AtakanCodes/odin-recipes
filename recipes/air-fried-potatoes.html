    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>This is one of my favorite dishes, it's simple, fast and straight up bussin'!
        
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    
    <ul>
        <li>3-4 humongous potatoes or 7-8 little ones. The main rule is to not pile them up too much or the ones in the middle aren't going to cook good enough in the air fryer.</li>
        <li>2-3 tbs of any frying oil. I use sunflower oil.</li>
        <li>1/2 tbs of salt</li>
        <li>1/3 tbs of oregano</li>
        <li>1/3 tbs of cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>1/3 tbs of dried mint</li>
        
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Peel the potatoes</li>
        <li>Put potatoes in the fryer basket</li>
        <li>Add oil and spices on the potatoes</li>
        <li>Mix it all</li>
        <li>Place the potatoes evenly in the basket, same sides looking up.</li>
        <li>Put it in the fryer and set it to cook for 30 minutes at 185 degrees celsius.</li>
        <li>After 15 minutes, turn the potatoes around.</li>
        <li>If they are not looking crispy after 15 minutes, add 5-10 more minutes. The timing will increase the more potatoes you load in the basket.</li>
        <li>Enjoy with or without condiments!</li>
    </ol>
